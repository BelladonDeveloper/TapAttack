# TapAttack

Press the button as many times as you can in 30 seconds.

Uses Google Play Games Services leaderboard and achievements.

TapAttack takes the [Get Started With Google Play Games Services](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/get-started-with-google-play-games-services--cms-27755) tutorial from [Ashraff Hathibelagal](https://github.com/hathibelagal) and combines it with the [TypeANumber](https://github.com/playgameservices/android-basic-samples) tutorial from Google.

TapAttack is a very simple, single Activity and single Layout, Android application example.
